# 4. CQRS 

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the system grows in complexity and size, there's potential for there to be challenges when managing both the read and write operations. 

There should be two types of requests: Queries (for read operations) and Commands (for write operations).

Queries should only read and have no side-effects, whereas commands should have side effects. 

## Decision

The CQRS pattern has been applied for each module. 

## Consequences

- Read and write oprations are completely segregated.
- Simplified maintenance. With a clearer separation of concerns, the codebase is easier to maintain and extend.
- The IModule facade should only be sending in Command or Query objects to the module.
